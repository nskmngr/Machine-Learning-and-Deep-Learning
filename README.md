Classification on the MNIST Handwritten Digit dataset involves data segmentation using clustering methods, experimenting with and comparing various supervised learning models, as well as designing a simple neural network (perceptron model).

1. Data Segmentation with Clustering Methods
The process of data segmentation involves using clustering techniques to divide data into homogeneous groups based on specific shared characteristics. In this context, it is expected to employ clustering methods for data segmentation.

2. Comparing Multiple Supervised Learning Models 
The ability to utilize different supervised learning models and compare their performance. Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where models are trained using labeled data. It is possible to try out several different models and compare how well they handle specific tasks.

3. Designing and Creating a Simple Neural Network (Perceptron Model) for the MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset
The ability to design and create a simple artificial neural network, particularly the perceptron model, for the MNIST Handwritten Digit dataset. MNIST is a dataset containing handwritten digit images from 0 to 9. Using the perceptron model, which is one type of simple neural network, to classify digits in this dataset.
